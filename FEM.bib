	abstract = {The present paper deals with the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for discretization in space. For DG methods applied to the dual splitting projection method, instabilities have recently been reported that occur for small time step sizes. Since the critical time step size depends on the viscosity and the spatial resolution, these instabilities limit the robustness of the Navier–Stokes solver in case of complex engineering applications characterized by coarse spatial resolutions and small viscosities. By means of numerical investigation we give evidence that these instabilities are related to the discontinuous Galerkin formulation of the velocity divergence term and the pressure gradient term that couple velocity and pressure. Integration by parts of these terms with a suitable definition of boundary conditions is required in order to obtain a stable and robust method. Since the intermediate velocity field does not fulfill the boundary conditions prescribed for the velocity, a consistent boundary condition is derived from the convective step of the dual splitting scheme to ensure high-order accuracy with respect to the temporal discretization. This new formulation is stable in the limit of small time steps for both equal-order and mixed-order polynomial approximations. Although the dual splitting scheme itself includes inf–sup stabilizing contributions, we demonstrate that spurious pressure oscillations appear for equal-order polynomials and small time steps highlighting the necessity to consider inf–sup stability explicitly.},

We consider a semi-explicit high-order velocity-correction method for time integration as well as nodal equal-order discretizations for velocity and pressure. The non-linear convective term is treated explicitly while a linear system is solved for the pressure Poisson equation and the viscous term. The key feature of our solver is a consistent penalty term reducing the local divergence error in order to overcome recently reported instabilities in spatially under-resolved high-Reynolds-number flows as well as small time steps. This penalty method is similar to the grad–div stabilization widely used in continuous finite elements. We further review and compare our method to several other techniques recently proposed in literature to stabilize the method for such flow configurations. The solver is specifically designed for large-scale computations through matrix-free linear solvers including efficient preconditioning strategies and tensor-product elements, which have allowed us to scale this code up to 34.4 billion degrees of freedom and 147,456 CPU cores. We validate our code and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with laminar flows present in a vortex problem and flow past a cylinder and show applicability of our solver to direct numerical simulation as well as implicit large-eddy simulation of turbulent channel flow at Reτ=180 as well as 590.},

	abstract = {We present a robust and accurate discretization approach for incompressible turbulent flows based on high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods. The DG discretization of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations uses the local Lax–Friedrichs flux for the convective term, the symmetric interior penalty method for the viscous term, and central fluxes for the velocity–pressure coupling terms. Stability of the discretization approach for under-resolved, turbulent flow problems is realized by a purely numerical stabilization approach. Consistent penalty terms that enforce the incompressibility constraint as well as inter-element continuity of the velocity field in a weak sense render the numerical method a robust discretization scheme in the under-resolved regime. The penalty parameters are derived by means of dimensional analysis using penalty factors of order 1. Applying these penalty terms in a postprocessing step leads to an efficient solution algorithm for turbulent flows. The proposed approach is applicable independently of the solution strategy used to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, i.e., it can be used for both projection-type solution methods as well as monolithic solution approaches. Since our approach is based on consistent penalty terms, it is by definition generic and provides optimal rates of convergence when applied to laminar flow problems. Robustness and accuracy are verified for the Orr–Sommerfeld stability problem, the Taylor–Green vortex problem, and turbulent channel flow. Moreover, the accuracy of high-order discretizations as compared to low-order discretizations is investigated for these flow problems. A comparison to state-of-the-art computational approaches for large-eddy simulation indicates that the proposed methods are highly attractive components for turbulent flow solvers.},

First, we express the approximate scalar variable and corresponding flux within each element in terms of an approximate trace of the scalar variable along the element boundary. We then define a unique value for the approximate trace by enforcing the continuity of the normal component of the flux across the element boundary; a global equation system solely in terms of the approximate trace is thus obtained. The high number of globally coupled degrees of freedom in the discontinuous Galerkin approximation is therefore significantly reduced. If the problem is time-dependent, we discretize the time derivative by means of backward difference formulae. This results in efficient schemes capable of producing high-order accurate solutions in space and time. Indeed, when the time-marching method is (p+1)th order accurate and when polynomials of degree p⩾0 are used to represent the scalar variable, the flux and the approximate trace, we observe that the approximations for the scalar variable, the flux and the trace of the scalar variable converge with the optimal order of p+1 in the L2-norm.

The method is devised by using the discontinuous Galerkin discretization for a velocity gradient-pressure–velocity formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with a special choice of the numerical traces. The method possesses several unique features which distinguish itself from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, it reduces the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the velocity and the mean of the pressure on element boundaries, thereby leading to a significant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Moreover, if the augmented Lagrangian method is used to solve the linearized system, the globally coupled unknowns become the approximate trace of the velocity only. Second, it provides, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of the velocity, pressure, and velocity gradient which converge with the optimal order of k+1 in the L2-norm, when polynomials of degree k⩾0 are used for all components of the approximate solution. And third, it displays superconvergence properties that allow us to use the above-mentioned optimal convergence properties to define an element-by-element postprocessing scheme to compute a new and better approximate velocity. Indeed, this new approximation is exactly divergence-free, H(div)-conforming, and converges with order k+2 for k⩾1 and with order 1 for k=0 in the L2-norm. Moreover, a novel and systematic way is proposed for imposing boundary conditions for the stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the method. This can be done on different parts of the boundary and does not result in the degradation of the optimal order of convergence properties of the method. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and accuracy properties of the method for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and for various polynomial degrees.},

We employ an incremental pressure correction and develop the corresponding HDG finite element discretization including consistent edge-space fluxes for the velocity predictor and pressure correction. We then derive the proper forms of the element-local and HDG edge-space final corrections for both velocity and pressure, including the HDG rotational correction. We also find and explain a consistency relation between the HDG stability parameters of the pressure correction and velocity predictor. We discuss and illustrate the effects of the time-splitting error. We then detail how to incorporate the HDG projection method time-split within standard IMEX-RK time-stepping schemes. Our high-order HDG projection schemes are implemented for arbitrary, mixed-element unstructured grids, with both straight-sided and curved meshes. In particular, we provide a quadrature-free integration method for a nodal basis that is consistent with the HDG method. To prevent numerical oscillations, we develop a selective nodal limiting approach.

We employ an incremental pressure correction and develop the corresponding HDG finite element discretization including consistent edge-space fluxes for the velocity predictor and pressure correction. We then derive the proper forms of the element-local and HDG edge-space final corrections for both velocity and pressure, including the HDG rotational correction. We also find and explain a consistency relation between the HDG stability parameters of the pressure correction and velocity predictor. We discuss and illustrate the effects of the time-splitting error. We then detail how to incorporate the HDG projection method time-split within standard IMEX-RK time-stepping schemes. Our high-order HDG projection schemes are implemented for arbitrary, mixed-element unstructured grids, with both straight-sided and curved meshes. In particular, we provide a quadrature-free integration method for a nodal basis that is consistent with the HDG method. To prevent numerical oscillations, we develop a selective nodal limiting approach.

Here, a three-dimensional finite-element model is presented for use in oceanic simulations. The main aim is to fully exploit the use of unstructured meshes in both the horizontal and vertical directions, in order to conform well to topography and coastlines, and also to enable the straightforward use of dynamic variable mesh resolution reflecting fluid flow. In addition, the model should be accurate and efficient under typical oceanographic conditions, and not make the hydrostatic approximation. For simplicity here however the model does assume the presence of a rigid lid. To cope with inherent instabilities present in finite-element simulations of incompressible flow, caused by the Lagrange multiplier role that pressure plays in satisfying incompressibility, a mixed formulation for representing velocity and pressure is employed. Additionally, instabilities occurring due to the advection-dominated nature of the flow are dealt with using linear Petrov–Galerkin methods. In the course of this work a different type of instability has also been observed, which has some similarities with the sigma coordinate pressure gradient problem. The instability results from the mixed nature of the finite-element formulation and consequent poor satisfaction of hydrostatic balance, which in turn manifests itself in errors and spurious velocities on distorted meshes, such as those typical over topography. A satisfactory solution to this problem is presented that involves a splitting of pressure and allows efficient computations, whether the flow be close to or far from a state of hydrostatic balance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

In addition, local consistency is critical and requires that the discrete tracer equation preserve constants in a closed domain and if there is no tracer source or sink. Local consistency, together with monotonicity, will ensure that no spurious tracer extrema occur. A three-dimensional, finite-element, shallow-water model is presented. The mesh is unstructured in the horizontal, extruded in the third dimension, and made up of multiple layers of prisms. In addition, the mesh is allowed to move in the vertical and adapts itself to the free-surface motions. It is shown that achieving consistency requires a discrete compatibility between the tracer and continuity equations. In addition, to ensure global tracer conservation in a consistent way, a discrete compatibility between the tracer, continuity, and free-surface elevation equations must be fulfilled. It is suggested that this compatibility constraint, together with the use of a numerically stable scheme, severely restricts the choice of usable finite-element spatial discretizations. A consistent and conservative time-stepping algorithm is described for which a unique time step is used. It is suggested that future research is needed in order to design a consistent and conservative split-explicit algorithm. Some illustrative test cases are presented in which the method is shown to satisfy all conservation properties. A few experiments in which consistency breaks down are carried out, and the consequences of this breakdown process are investigated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

In particular, the code has been developed to simulate the nonlinear, nonhydrostatic internal wave ﬁeld in the littoral ocean. The method is based on the formulation developed by Casulli, in that the free-surface and vertical diﬀusion are semi-implicit, thereby removing stability limitations associated with the surface gravity wave and vertical diﬀusion terms. The remaining terms in the momentum equations are discretized explicitly with the second-order Adams–Bashforth method, while the pressure-correction method is employed for the nonhydrostatic pressure in order to achieve overall second-order temporal accuracy. Advection of momentum is accomplished with an Eulerian discretization which conserves momentum in cells that do not contain the free surface, and scalar advection is discretized in a way that ensures consistency with continuity, thereby ensuring local and global mass conservation using a velocity ﬁeld that conserves volume on a local and global basis. The nonhydrostatic pressure ﬁeld is solved eﬃciently using a block-Jacobi preconditioner, and while stability is limited by the internal gravity wave speed and vertical advection of momentum, applications requiring relatively small time steps due to accuracy or stability constraints are run eﬃciently on parallel computers, since the present formulation is written entirely with the message-passing interface (MPI). The ParMETIS libraries are employed in order to achieve a load-balanced parallel partitioning that minimizes interprocessor communication, and the grid is reordered to optimize per-processor performance by limiting cache misses while accessing arrays in memory. Test cases demonstrate the ability of the code to eﬃciently and accurately compute the nonhydrostatic lock exchange and internal waves in idealized as well as real domains, and we evaluate the parallel eﬃciency of the code using up to 32 processors.},

First, they reduce the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the velocity, which is deﬁned on the element faces and single-valued, thereby leading to a signiﬁcant saving in the computational cost. In addition, all the approximate variables (including the approximate velocity and gradient) converge with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L2-norm, when polynomials of degree k P 0 are used to represent the numerical solution and when the time-stepping method is accurate with order k + 1. When the time-stepping method is of order k + 2, superconvergence properties allows us, by means of local postprocessing, to obtain better, yet inexpensive approximations of the displacement and velocity at any time levels for which an enhanced accuracy is required. In particular, the new approximations converge with order k + 2 in the L2-norm when k P 1 for both acoustics and elastodynamics.

	abstract = {We present hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving steady and timedependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in continuum mechanics. The essential ingredients are a local Galerkin projection of the underlying PDEs at the element level onto spaces of polynomials of degree k to parametrize the numerical solution in terms of the numerical trace; a judicious choice of the numerical ﬂux to provide stability and consistency; and a global jump condition that enforces the continuity of the numerical ﬂux to arrive at a global weak formulation in terms of the numerical trace. The HDG methods are fully implicit, high-order accurate and endowed with several unique features which distinguish themselves from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, they reduce the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the solution on element boundaries, thereby leading to a signiﬁcant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Second, they provide, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of all the variables which converge with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L2-norm. Third, they possess some superconvergence properties that allow us to deﬁne inexpensive element-by-element postprocessing procedures to compute a new approximate solution which may converge with higher order than the original solution. And fourth, they allow for a novel and systematic way for imposing boundary conditions for the total stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the methods. In addition, they possess other interesting properties for speciﬁc problems. Their approximate solution can be postprocessed to yield an exactly divergence-free and H(div)-conforming velocity ﬁeld for incompressible ﬂows. They do not exhibit volumetric locking for nearly incompressible solids. We provide extensive numerical results to illustrate their distinct characteristics and compare their performance with that of continuous Galerkin methods. Ó 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Nevertheless, the vertical momentum, and, hence, the nonhydrostatic pressure component, cannot be neglected when the bottom topography of the domain changes abruptly, as in cases of short waves, or when the flow is determined by strong density gradients. In this paper a numerical method for the three-dimensional (3D) quasi-hydrostatic, free-surface flows is outlined. The governing equations are the Reynolds-averaged Navier-{\textasciitilde}tokes equations with the pressure decomposed into the sum of a hydrostatic component and a hydrodynamic component. The momentum equations, the incompressibility condition, and the equation for the free surface are integrated by a time-splitting method in such a fashion that the resulting numerical solution is mass conservative and stable at a minimal computational cost. Several applications serve to illustrate the effect of the deviation from the hydrostatic pressure.},

The model equations invoke a mild isopycnal-slope approximation to remove small metric terms associated with diffusion and nonhydrostatic pressure from the momentum equations and to reduce the pressure Poisson equation to a symmetric linear system. Avoiding this approximation requires a costlier inversion of a non-symmetric linear system. We demonstrate that the model is capable of simulating nonlinear internal solitary waves for simpliﬁed and physically-realistic ocean-scale problems with a reduced number of layers.},

These methods are an extension of the Runge–Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) methods for purely hyperbolic systems to convection-diﬀusion systems and share with those methods their high parallelizability, high-order formal accuracy, and easy handling of complicated geometries for convection-dominated problems. It is proven that for scalar equations, the LDG methods are L2-stable in the nonlinear case. Moreover, in the linear case, it is shown that if polynomials of degree k are used, the methods are kth order accurate for general triangulations; although this order of convergence is suboptimal, it is sharp for the LDG methods. Preliminary numerical examples displaying the performance of the method are shown.},

The inviscid term is discretized by using a simplified artificial compressibility flux which can be obtained explicitly and straightforwardly without entailing any numerical iterative procedure for solving a Riemann problem of a nonlinear system. And the viscous term is discretized by the direct DG (DDG) method which was developed based on the weak formulation of the scalar diffusion problems on structured grids. A number of test cases are presented to assess the performance of the DDG method compared to the widely used BR2 method for solving the INS equations. The numerical results indicate that the DDG method can achieve the designed order of accuracy and is able to deliver comparable accuracy as the BR2 method. Due to its simplicity in implementation, the DDG method provides an attractive alternative for solving the INS equations on arbitrary grids.},

	abstract = {We present a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in convection-dominated flows using triangular and tetrahedral meshes. The scheme is based on a semi-explicit temporal discretization with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and implicit treatment of the Stokes operator. The nonlinear term is discretized in divergence form by using the local Lax–Friedrichs fluxes; thus, local conservativity is inherent. Spatial discretization of the Stokes operator has employed both equal-order (Pk−Pk) and mixed-order (Pk−Pk−1) velocity and pressure approximations. A second-order approximate algebraic splitting is used to decouple the velocity and pressure calculations leading to an algebraic Helmholtz equation for each component of the velocity and a consistent Poisson equation for the pressure. The consistent Poisson operator is replaced by an equivalent (in stability and convergence) operator, namely that arising from the interior penalty discretization of the standard Poisson operator with appropriate boundary conditions. This yields a simpler and more efficient method, characterized by a compact stencil size. We show the temporal and spatial behavior of the method by solving some popular benchmarking tests. For an unsteady Stokes problem, second-order temporal convergence is obtained, while for the Taylor vortex test problem on both semi-structured and fully unstructured triangular meshes, spectral convergence with respect to the polynomial degree k is obtained. By studying the Orr–Sommerfeld stability problem, we demonstrate that the Pk−Pk method yields a stable solution, while the Pk−Pk−1 formulation leads to unphysical instability. The good performance of the method is further shown by simulating vortex shedding in flow past a square cylinder. We conclude that the proposed discontinuous Galerkin method with the Pk−Pk formulation is an efficient scheme for accurate and stable solution of the unsteady Navier–Stokes equations in convection-dominated flows.},

	abstract = {Both compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes solvers can be used and are used to solve incompressible turbulent flow problems. In the compressible case, the Mach number is then considered as a solver parameter that is set to a small value, M ≈ 0.1, in order to mimic incompressible flows. This strategy is widely used for high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The present work raises the question regarding the computational efficiency of compressible DG solvers as compared to an incompressible formulation. Our contributions to the state of the art are twofold: Firstly, we present a high-performance DG solver for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations based on a highly efficient matrix-free implementation that targets modern cache-based multicore architectures with Flop/Byte ratios significantly larger than 1. The performance results presented in this work focus on the node-level performance, and our results suggest that there is great potential for further performance improvements for current state-of-the-art DG implementations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Secondly, this compressible Navier-Stokes solver is put into perspective by comparing it to an incompressible DG solver that uses the same matrix-free implementation. We discuss algorithmic differences between both solution strategies and present an in-depth numerical investigation of the performance. The considered benchmark test cases are the three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex problem as a representative of transitional flows and the turbulent channel flow problem as a representative of wall-bounded turbulent flows. The results indicate a clear performance advantage of the incompressible formulation over the compressible one.},

High-order accurate arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulations are proposed in a uniﬁed framework for both monolithic as well as projection or splitting-type Navier–Stokes solvers. The framework is ﬂexible, allows implicit and explicit formulations of the convective term, and adaptive time-stepping. The Navier–Stokes equations with ALE transport term are solved on the deformed geometry storing one instance of the mesh that is updated from one time step to the next. Discretization in space is applied to the time discrete equations so that all weak forms and mass matrices are evaluated at the end of the current time step. This design ensures that the proposed formulations fulﬁll the geometric conservation law automatically, as is shown theoretically and demonstrated numerically by the example of the free-stream preservation test. We discuss the peculiarities related to the imposition of boundary conditions in intermediate steps of projectiontype methods and the ingredients needed to preserve high-order accuracy. We show numerically that the formulations proposed in this work maintain the formal order of accuracy of the Navier–Stokes solvers. Moreover, we demonstrate robustness and accuracy for under-resolved turbulent ﬂows.},

With this assumption, a three-dimensional, hydrodynamic model can be significantly simplified because the momentum equation in the vertical direction is reduced to an expression of hydrostatic pressure. While such a simplification is valid in many shallow water applications, there exist no rigorous guidelines as to what extent can the hydrostatic assumption be safely used without any problems.},

The resulting scheme naturally ensures conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. A semi-implicit time-integration approach is adopted to improve the eﬃciency of the scheme with respect to the explicit Runge–Kutta time integration strategies usually employed in the context of DG formulations. A method is also presented to reformulate the resulting linear system as a pseudo-Helmholtz problem. In doing this, we obtain a DG discretization closely related to those proposed for the solution of elliptic problems, and we show how to take advantage of the numerical integration rules (required in all DG methods for the area and ﬂux integrals) to increase the eﬃciency of the solution algorithm. The resulting numerical formulation is then validated on a collection of classical two-dimensional test cases, including density driven ﬂows and mountain wave simulations. The performance analysis shows that the semi-implicit method is, indeed, superior to explicit methods and that the pseudo-Helmholtz formulation yields further eﬃciency improvements.},

	abstract = {The spindown of a geostrophically balanced density front in an upper-ocean mixed layer is simulated with a large eddy simulation (LES) model that resolves O(1000) m down to O(1) m scale. Our goal is to examine the interaction between the submesoscale and the turbulent finescale, and another related goal is to use the turbulence-resolving simulation to better characterize vertical transport, frontogenesis and dissipative processes. The flow passes through symmetric and baroclinic instabilities, spawns vortex filaments of O (100) m thickness as well as larger eddies with cross-front velocity as large as the along-front velocity, and develops turbulence that is spatially localized and organized. A O(100) m physical-space filter is applied to the simulated flow so that the coherent submesoscale is separated from the finescale in a decomposition that preserves the spatial organization of the flow unlike the typical practice of a split into a frontal average and a fluctuation that obscures the coherent submesoscale. The energy spectrum exhibits a change of slope at O(100) m with an approximately −5/3 slope over a subrange of the finescale. Analysis of the submesoscale vertical velocity (as large as 5mm/s) in the upper layer of the front reveals that downwelling is limited to the thin vortex filaments and the junction of the submesoscale eddies with these filaments while upwelling occurs over spatially extensive regions in the eddies. Conditional averaging shows that heavier (lighter) fluid is preferentially downwelled (upwelled) by these coherent submesoscale structures leading to an overall buoyancy flux that is restratifying. The submesoscale is unbalanced with local Rossby number as large as 5. The kinetic energy (KE) transport equations are evaluated separately for the submesoscale and the finescale to understand energy pathways in this problem. The buoyancy flux (associated with coherent motions) transfers the potential energy of the front and acts as the primary source of submesoscale KE which is then transported across the front with a fraction transferred to the finescale. The transfer, limited to thin regions of O(100) m horizontal width, is accomplished by primarily horizontal strain in the upper 10 m and by vertical shear in the rest of the 50-m deep mixed layer. Frontogenetic mechanisms are diagnosed through analysis of the transport equation for squared buoyancy gradient. Horizontal strain is the primary frontogenetic term that is especially strong in the near-surface layer. The frontogenesis is counteracted primarily by horizontal diffusion in the top 10 m while, further below, the balance is with the horizontal gradient of vertical velocity.},

	abstract = {During the winter from 2009 to 2013, the mixed layer reached the seaﬂoor at about 2500 m in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Intense fronts around the deep convection area were repeatedly sampled by autonomous gliders. Subduction down to 200–300 m, sometimes deeper, below the mixed layer was regularly observed testifying of important frontal vertical movements. Potential Vorticity dynamics was diagnosed using glider observations and a high resolution realistic model at 1-km resolution. During down-front wind events in winter, remarkable layers of negative PV were observed in the upper 100 m on the dense side of fronts surrounding the deep convection area and successfully reproduced by the numerical model. Under such conditions, symmetric instability can grow and overturn water along isopycnals within typically 1–5 km cross-frontal slanted cells. Two important hotpspots for the destruction of PV along the topographically-steered Northern Current undergoing frequent down-front winds have been identiﬁed in the western part of Gulf of Lion and Ligurian Sea. Fronts were there symmetrically unstable for up to 30 days per winter in the model, whereas localized instability events were found in the open sea, mostly inﬂuenced by mesoscale variability. The associated vertical circulations also had an important signature on oxygen and ﬂuorescence, highlighting their under important role for the ventilation of intermediate layers, phytoplankton growth and carbon export.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional transport pathways, the time and space scales of vertical transport, and the dispersion characteristics (single-, pair- and multi-particle statistics) of submesoscale currents at an upper-ocean front are investigated using material points (tracer particles) that advect with the local fluid velocity. Coherent vortex filaments and eddies, generated and sustained during the evolution of baroclinic instability, dominate submesoscale (0.1 - 10 km) dynamics. These coherent structures play a crucial role in the particle transport and dispersion, which we quantify here. Particles in the central frontal region organize into vertically inclined lobes with anticyclonic circulation, each associated with a coherent eddy with cyclonic rotation. Furthermore, the coherent filaments associated with heavy/light edges of the front transfer particles from the edges to the lobes by downwelling/upwelling. This flux of new particles into the central region causes the particles circulating in the lobes to adjust, which leads to slumping of the front. The particle motion in the vertical shows multiple time scales – a fast time scale with 𝑂(10 m) vertical displacement within an hour and a slower near-inertial time scale, comparable to the intrinsic time scale of the growing instability. The fast 𝑂(1 h) time scale is also seen in the decorrelation of vertical velocity and the tapering of the initial ballistic growth of relative particle dispersion. The overall slumping process is slower than what one might anticipate from the large magnitude of vertical velocity in the filaments since it requires a sustained correlation over time between the lateral and the vertical motion. By tracking clouds of particles, we show that their centers of mass downwell/upwell over 1 − 2 inertial time periods, after which an adjustment follows with a sub-inertial time scale. The shape change in clusters of four particles reveals filamentogenesis, i.e. deformation into thin, needle-like structures by the coherent, anisotropic motions of the submesoscale, which occurs as a rapid process that is complete within approximately an hour.},

Through a spectral analysis of the projection operator’s SIP-DG discretization, we demonstrate that the eigenfunctions of the operator do not form a basis that allows for the correct enforcement of the incompressibility constraint. This short-coming can cause numerical instabilities for inviscid, advection-dominated, and density stratified flow simulations, especially for long-time integrations and/or under-resolved situations. To remedy this problem, we propose a local post-processing projection that enforces incompressibility exactly to allow for stable and robust long-time integrations.},

Two high order h/p variational methods encompassing continuous and discontinuous Galerkin formulations are used to explain previously observed lower limits on the time step for projection type schemes to be stable [18], when h- or p-reﬁnement strategies are considered. In addition, the analysis included in this work shows that these stability limits do not depend only on the time step but on the product of the latter and the kinematic viscosity, which is of particular importance in the study of high Reynolds number ﬂows. We show that high order methods prove advantageous in stabilising the simulations when small time steps and low kinematic viscosities are used.},

	abstract = {A method for post-processing the velocity after a pressure projection is developed that helps to maintain stability in an under-resolved, inviscid, discontinuous element-based simulation for use in environmental fluid mechanics process studies. The post-processing method is needed because of spurious divergence growth at element interfaces due to the discontinuous nature of the discretization used. This spurious divergence eventually leads to a numerical instability. Previous work has shown that a discontinuous element-local projection onto the space of divergence-free basis functions is capable of stabilizing the projection method, but the discontinuity inherent in this technique may lead to instability in under-resolved simulations. By enforcing inter-element discontinuity and requiring a divergence-free result in the weak sense only, a new post-processing technique is developed that simultaneously improves smoothness and reduces divergence in the pressure-projected velocity field at the same time. When compared against a non-post-processed velocity field, the post-processed velocity field remains stable far longer and exhibits better smoothness and conservation properties.},

The two minisymposia on OBCs that are summarized in this paper had the objective of finding the best OBCs for a small subset of two-dimensional test problems. This objective, which of course is not really well-defined, was not met (we believe), but the contributions obtained probably raised many more questions/issues than were resolved—notable among them being the advent of a new class of OBCs that we call FBCs (fuzzy boundary conditions).},

	abstract = {Many large-scale simulations of internal waves are computed with ocean models solving the primitive (hydrostatic) equations. Under certain circumstances, however, internal waves can represent a dynamical balance between nonlinearity and nonhydrostasy (dispersion), and thus may require computationally expensive nonhydrostatic simulations to be well-resolved. Most discretizations of the primitive equations are second-order accurate, inducing numerical dispersion generated from odd-order terms in the truncation error (3rd-order derivatives and higher). This numerical dispersion mimics physical dispersion due to nonhydrostasy. In this paper, we determine the numerical dispersion coefﬁcient associated with common discretizations of the primitive equations. We compare this coefﬁcient to the physical dispersion coefﬁcient from the Boussinesq equations or KdV equation. The results show that, to lowest order, the ratio of numerical to physical dispersion is C = Kk2, where K is an O(1) constant dependent on the discretization of the governing equations and k is the grid leptic ratio, k  Dx/h1, where Dx is the horizontal grid spacing and h1 is the depth of the internal interface. In addition to deriving this relationship, we verify that it indeed holds in a nonhydrostatic ocean model (SUNTANS). To ensure relative dominance of physical over numerical effects, simulations require C ( 1. Based on this condition, the horizontal grid spacing required for proper resolution of nonhydrostatic effects is k {\textless} O(1) or Dx {\textless} h1. When this condition is not satisﬁed, numerical dispersion overwhelms physical dispersion, and modeled internal waves exist with a dynamical balance between nonlinearity and numerical dispersion. Satisfaction of this condition may be a signiﬁcant additional resolution requirement beyond the current state-of-the-art in ocean modeling.},

However, non-linear internal wave evolution is fundamentally non-hydrostatic, so any hydrostatic model will eventually fail if non-hydrostatic eﬀects accumulate. In this paper, we demonstrate that the time scale of baroclinic wave steepening provides a temporal horizon for model skill when suﬃciently ﬁne model grid scales are applied. At coarser grid scales, model results may be dominated by either diﬀusion or dissipation prior to the time scale of steepening. Methods for estimating numerical viscosity and diﬀusivity are developed, along with approximate predictive scales for the Centre for Water Research Estuary and Lake Computer Model (CWR-ELCOM). Results indicate that numerical diﬀusion of the pycnocline (i.e. thermocline or halocline) may rapidly increase past the time scale of steepening for a well-resolved model, and that somewhat coarser horizontal grid scales may be preferable for integrations beyond the time scale of steepening. While the present application and analyses are for a speciﬁc model, the methodology is developed in a general formulation and could be applied to other models for insight into error accumulation.},

	abstract = {To simulate the dynamical structures of stratiﬁed shear ﬂows, the high-resolution Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) method is necessary and widely-used due to its high-order spatial accuracy, oscillation control, and ability to capture the well-deﬁned structures of vortices. Lack of understanding the TVD slope limiters usually results in inaccurate numerical simulation on stratiﬁed shear ﬂows in terms of shear instability and spatiotemporal variations of mixing. In this study, the performances of four typical TVD slope limiters, namely the minmod, van Leer, Monotonized Central (MC), and superbee limiters, were investigated on modelling stratiﬁed shear ﬂows based on the open-source non-hydrostatic model, NHWAVE. The four slope limiters are all commonly-used and have the typical numerical characteristics. All the limiters were respectively applied in two classical test cases, namely, shear instability and lock-exchange problem. The simulation results showed that the effects of slope limiters were correlated with their characteristics of numerical dissipation (or anti-dissipation), which can inﬂuence notably the model predictions of the generation of shear instability, the development of interfacial structures, and the mixing process. In the test cases, MC limiter’s performance was the best, because it could simulate the well-deﬁned structures of instability while not introducing noticeable error. Minmod has an excessively large dissipation, which introduced noticeable numerical errors that can inﬂuence the model accuracy and can even suppress or omit the generation of interfacial vortices. Superbee limiter, the most anti-dissipative one, usually over-predicted the instability and mixing effects in time and space domain, and was likely to cause computational instability in some cases. The performances of van Leer and MC were similar, but their predictions of the evolutions of interfacial structures and mixing could be signiﬁcantly different. Besides, the co-effects of grid resolution and slope limiters were also investigated; it was found that the reﬁnement of grids may not help to reproduce a higher-quality result with a speciﬁc slope limiter.},

	abstract = {In this work, we discuss and develop multidimensional limiting techniques for discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of scalar hyperbolic problems. To ensure that each cell average satisﬁes a local discrete maximum principle (DMP), we impose inequality constraints on the local Lax-Friedrichs ﬂuxes of a piecewise-linear (P1) approximation. Since the piecewise-constant (P0) version corresponds to a property-preserving low-order ﬁnite volume method, the validity of DMP conditions can always be enforced using slope and/or ﬂux limiters. We show that the (currently rather uncommon) use of direct ﬂux limiting makes it possible to construct more accurate DMP-satisfying approximations in which a weak form of slope limiting is used to prevent unbounded growth of solution gradients. Moreover, both ﬂuxes and slopes can be limited in a manner which produces nonlinear problems with welldeﬁned residuals even at steady state. We derive/present slope limiters based on diﬀerent kinds of inequality constraints, discuss their properties and introduce new anisotropic limiters for problems that require diﬀerent treatment of diﬀerent space directions. At the ﬂux limiting stage, the anisotropy of the problem at hand can be taken into account by using a customized deﬁnition of local bounds for the DMP constraints. At the slope limiting stage, we adjust the magnitude of individual directional derivatives using low-order reconstructions from cell averages to deﬁne the bounds. In this way, we avoid unnecessary limiting of well-resolved derivatives at smooth peaks and in internal/boundary layers. The properties of selected algorithms are explored in numerical studies for DG-P1 discretizations of two-dimensional test problems. In the context of hp-adaptive DG methods, the new limiting procedures can be used in P1 subcells of macroelements marked as ‘troubled’ by a smoothness indicator.},

	abstract = {In a recent paper [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 47 (2009), pp. 3451–3463] Sayas proved the stability of the Johnson–Nédélec coupling of finite and boundary element methods on polygonal interfaces when the direct boundary integral equation with single and double layer integral operators is used only. In this note we present two alternative proofs of this result for general Lipschitz interfaces. In particular, we prove an ellipticity estimate of the coupled bilinear form. Hence, we can use standard arguments to derive stability and error estimates for the Galerkin discretization for all pairs of finite and boundary element trial spaces.},

	title = {Iterative {Solution} {Methods}},
	isbn = {978-0-521-55569-2},
	abstract = {This book deals primarily with the numerical solution of linear systems of equations by iterative methods. The first part of the book is intended to serve as a textbook for a numerical linear algebra course. The material assumes the reader has a basic knowledge of linear algebra, such as set theory and matrix algebra, however it is demanding for students who are not afraid of theory. To assist the reader, the more difficult passages have been marked, the definitions for each chapter are collected at the beginning of the chapter, and numerous exercises are included throughout the text. The second part of the book serves as a monograph introducing recent results in the iterative solution of linear systems, mainly using preconditioned conjugate gradient methods. This book should be a valuable resource for students and researchers alike wishing to learn more about iterative methods.},

	abstract = {Recently, nanoindentation technique is gaining importance in determination of the mechanical parameters of thin films and coatings. Most commonly, the instrumented indentation data are used to obtain two material characteristics of bulk materials: indentation modulus and indentation hardness. In this paper the authors discuss the possibility by means of numerical simulations of nanoindentation tests to obtained the force-displacement curve employing various constitutive models for both the substrate and the coating. Examples are given to demonstrate the influence of some features of the numerical model and the model assumptions on the quality of the simulation results. The main steps in creation of the numerical model and performing the numerical simulation of nanoindentation testing process are systematically studied and explained and the conclusions are drawn.},
