In \cite{fehn_robust_2018}, the authors investigate the stability and robustness of DG discretizations of several projection methods. They compare fully-implicit, high-order dual splitting \cite{karniadakis_high-order_1991}, and pressure-correction schemes, but weirdly discretize the advection term implicitly for the pressure-correction, making the system nonlinear. So not exactly a fair comparison, since solving a nonlinear problem defeats the purpose of a projection method.

The numerical experiments in \cite{fehn_robust_2018} suggest that the high-order, dual splitting scheme 


\subsection{Incompressible Navier--Stokes}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial \bm{u}}{\partial t} 
    + \nabla \cdot \left(\bm{u} \otimes \bm{u}\right) 
    - \nabla \cdot \left(\nu \nabla\bm{u}\right)
    + \nabla p = \bm{f} & \qquad \text{ on } \Omega \times [0,T] \\
    \nabla \cdot \bm{u} = 0 & \qquad  \text{ on } \Omega \times [0,T]
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:INS}
\end{equation}

Th incompressible Navier--stokes equations are subject to the initial condition
\begin{equation}
  \bm{u}(\bm{x},t=0) = \bm{u}_0 \text{ on } \Omega,
\end{equation}
where $\bm{u}_0$ is divergence-free. We denote the outward-facing unit normal vector as $\bm{n}$.  On the boundary $\Gamma$, we prescribe Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on $\Gamma_D$ and $\Gamma_N$, respectively, such that $\Gamma_D \cup \Gamma_N = \Gamma$.  
\begin{eqnarray}
  \bm{u} &= \bm{g}_D^u & \text{ on } \Gamma_D \times [0,T] \\ 
  \left(\bm{F}_v\left(\bm{u}\right) - p\bm{I}\right)\cdot\bm{n} &= \bm{g}_N^{\text{stress}} & \text{ on } \Gamma_D \times [0,T] 
\end{eqnarray}
Where $\bm{F}_v(\bm{u})$ is a representation of the viscous flux, usually given as $\bm{F}_v(\bm{u})=\nu \nabla \bm{u}$. The operator splitting associated with projection methods will necessitate splitting the boundary condition as well, so we decompose the stress condition into viscous and pressure components $\bm{g}_N^{\text{stress}} = \bm{g}_N^u - g_N^p\bm{n}$ and prescribe them separately, following \cite{fehn_robust_2018},
\begin{eqnarray}
  \bm{F}_v(\bm{u}) \cdot\bm{n} &= \bm{g}_N^u & \text{ on } \Gamma_N, \\
  p &= g_N^p & \text{ on } \Gamma_N.
\end{eqnarray}

We use the Rothe method, handling the temporal discretization and operator splitting before spatial discretization. For time integration, we apply backward differentiation formula (BDF) for all schemes in this paper.

\section{Discussion}%

The imposition of open boundary conditions where inflow and outflow can co-exist remains an open problem in the finite element community \cite{sani_resume_1994}.
